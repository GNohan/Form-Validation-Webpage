# Form-Validation-Webpage
A webpage displaying form vaidation functionality using Regex.

# Additional Information
This was a project my web dev class focusing on javascript. I reuploaded this as part of my GitHub cleanup. 
This script uses common regular expressions that can be re used for general information validation. *You can find the regular expressions in the mainScript.js file.*
I hope somebody may find a small piece of this code useful or interesting.
